### ðŸ‘‹&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello there

I'm **Ivan Ermakov**,

A Russian indie-game developer, currently studying in High School.

I have the most experience with C# and Python, but I also tried making stuff with other languages. My game engine of choice is Godot 4, which I'm trying to get accustomed to after working in Unity for a couple years.
You can contact me on Discord: @iver0.
