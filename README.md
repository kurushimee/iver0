### ðŸ‘‹&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello there

I'm **Ivan Ermakov**,

A  game developer that looks for a job.

I mainly use C# and Python, but I know some Java too. My game engine of choice is Unity, began working in it during 2019. Currently I'm trying to delve deeper into indie game development and I hope it'll work out!
