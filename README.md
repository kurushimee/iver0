Hi, I'm Ivan Ermakov. I'm a 16 year old game designer and software engineer. Mainly I use C# and Python, but I know some Java, C++, and Clojure. My game engine of choice is Unity, began working in it during 2019. Currently I'm trying to delve deeper into indie game development and I hope it'll work out! I'd love to communicate with other developers! You can contact me on Discord: iver#9069.
