Hi, I'm Ivan Ermakov. I'm a 17 year old game designer and software engineer. I mainly use C# and Python, but I know some F#, Java, C++, and Clojure. My game engine of choice is Unity, began working in it during 2019. Currently I'm trying to delve deeper into indie game development and I hope it'll work out!
